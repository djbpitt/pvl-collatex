1.2: Ost fails to move 3 to 4; this is a digits/words mismatch that might be addressed with a thesaurus.

8.20: The movement of the last token in Rad to the last column is correct, but the one before it should remain in the antepenultimate column, instead of moving to the penult. It's a one-letter match in both columns, but there's a severe difference in length, which is relevant: the long words are verbs and the short ones are pronouns.

9.19: In Rad, Aka, Ipa, Xle, and Ost, columns 2 and 3 should be shifted one to the right. This may be an artifact of our looking only from right to left; we make the best decision for the last tokens without regard to the first, and that turns out to be suboptimal once we look further to the left.
